# alx-higher_level_programming Repository

Welcome to the alx-higher_level_programming repository. This repository contains various Python and Shell scripts serving different purposes, each explained below:

- **0-run:** A Shell script that runs a Python script. The Python file name is stored in the environment variable `$PYFILE`.

- **1-run_inline:** A Shell script that runs Python code. The Python code is stored in the environment variable `$PYCODE`.

- **2-print.py:** A Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle," followed by a new line.

- **3-print_number.py:** A Python script that prints the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by "Battery street," and then a new line.

- **4-print_float.py:** A Python script that prints the float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits, followed by a new line.

- **5-print_string.py:** A Python script that prints 3 times a string stored in the variable `str`, followed by its first 9 characters.

- **6-concat.py:** A Python script that prints "Welcome to Holberton School!".

- **7-edges.py:** A Python script that prints the first 3 letters of the variable `word`, the last 2 letters of the variable `word`, and the value of the variable `word` without the first and last letters.

- **8-concat_edges.py:** A Python script that prints "object-oriented programming with Python," followed by a new line.

- **9-easter_egg.py:** A Python script that prints "The Zen of Python," by Tim Peters, followed by a new line.

- **100-write.py:** A Python script that prints exactly "and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19", followed by a new line. The script prints to stderr and exits with the status code 1.

- **101-compile:** A Shell script that compiles a Python script file. The Python file name is stored in the environment variable `$PYFILE`.

**Note:** For tasks involving Python scripts, the output is produced by executing the script. For tasks involving Shell scripts, the output is produced by running the script using `./<script_name>`. For C tasks, `gcc` is used to compile the code and then the output executable is run.

Enjoy exploring the code!
